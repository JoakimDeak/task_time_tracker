/**
 
  color palette idea
  background of #2c0e37 or a dark gray would probably be better like #131b26, #06191d, #1e1c1c, #212121
  ui elements of #690375
  text of #fcfaf9


  the same color can be reused if you change the saturation. for example having an outline on the edit button on trackers


  maybe add the bi flag as a wavey background thingy. whould be sick and subtle
